\chapter{Conclusion}

The internship at the Bosch CR/AAS3 department was my first experience in a large and professional company. It opens up my point of view about the complete process of software development. I still have many gaps of knowledge to fill, but unlike before, I have more awareness of the direction to follow. During the internship, I mainly code and work with software. The Corona situation made it harder to work and cooperate with others. Regardless, it was a great opportunity, allowing me to learn, experience and prepare for the future.
