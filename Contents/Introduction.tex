\chapter{Introduction}

In the last semester of the robotic master program, there are two paths to follow: either focusing on academic research or gaining more industrial experience. With a desire to gain more hands-on experiences and skills, I decided to pursuit the industrial track, which requires a mandatory internship at an external company. I have already finished the master thesis at the Robert Bosch GmbH before the internship. Around the end of the thesis, my supervisors and I have discussed and agreed to continue on an 12-week internship.\\

Robert Bosch GmbH \cite{bosch}, also known as Bosch, is a multinational engineering and technology company. It was founded by Robert Bosch in 1886 in Stuttgart and currently is headquartered at Gerlingen. The company majors in four business sectors: Mobility Solutions, Industrial Technology, Consumer Goods, and Energy and Building Technology.\\

During the internship, I implemented additional features, which relate to my master thesis, into the department's robotic pipeline. The goal is to support the development of the next generation cleaning robot. This report summarizes what I have learn during the time spending at the company.
